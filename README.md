# Docker_files

## What is it used for
My archive of docker compose files to self host everything on my server

I'm using .env files and every folder should have an example file, just rename it to .env.
The reason I use that, is that I can upload my compose files without publishing private data like usernames, password etc.

## Why am I doing this
Well I dont know. I could host my own GitLab or Gitea Server but I think that a public GitHub repository helps me keep my stuff cleaner.

And maybe it will help you too sometime when you find this.
